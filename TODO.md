1. [x] Have the generated CSS file return from scalelar.com/layout.css or something like that so I can use it in Codepen without having to worry about manually copying and pasting.

3. Add an option to remove all unused css and generate a file with only the css that's being used.

4. [x] Add the colors in there from the colors that you're going to use.

5. Could probably cut the size of this thing down by half I properly thought about how to create functions. Lots of code duplication here. It works for now.

6. Fix the issue with the pullers and pushers not being generated correctly. (NaN)
