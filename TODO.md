1. [x] Have the generated CSS file return from scalelar.com/layout.css or something like that so I can use it in Codepen without having to worry about manually copying and pasting.

2. [x] Dynamically generate the responsive Grid classes

3. Add an option to remove all unused css and generate a file with only the css that's being used.

4. Add the colors in there from the colors that you're going to use.

5. Could probably cut the size of this thing down by half I properly thought about how to create functions. Lots of code duplication here. It works for now.
